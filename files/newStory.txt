(SAHANA) 
O Vishal, Vishal, wherefore art thou Vishal? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name, 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Kuchibhotla. 
(VISHAL) 
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? 
(SAHANA) 
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy. 
Thou art thyself, though not a Yathish. 
What’s Yathish? It is nor hand, nor foot, 
Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name 
Belonging to a man. 
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose 
By any other word would smell as sweet. 
So Vishal would, were he not Vishal called, 
Retain that dear perfection which he owes 
Without that title. Vishal, doff thy name, 
And, for thy name, which is no part of thee, 
Take all myself. 
(VISHAL) 
I take thee at thy word. 
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized. 
Henceforth I never will be Vishal. 
(SAHANA) 
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, 
So stumblest on my counsel? 
By a name 
(VISHAL) 
I know not how to tell thee who I am. 
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself 
Because it is an enemy to thee. 
Had I it written, I would tear the word. 
(SAHANA) 
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words 
Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound. 
Art thou not Vishal, and a Yathish? 
(VISHAL) 
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. 
(SAHANA) 
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? 
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, 
And the place death, considering who thou art, 
If any of my kinsmen find thee here. 
(VISHAL) 
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls, 
For stony limits cannot hold love out, 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt. 
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
